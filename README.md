# Automatization: Single Agents, homogeneous and heterogeneous societies (AASMA 2019/2020)

## Topics covered
* Autonomous Agents
    * Rationale agents
    * Costs of exchanging tasks
    * Selective memory
    * Flexible and conservative traits

* Multi-Agent Systems
    * Homogeneous and heterogeneous societies: cooperative society


This project considers the problem of automatization, where agents can possess skills and resources that determine their ability to successfully accomplish specific tasks.

These agents need to be prepared to learn from experience in order to select the most promising tasks at a given time.

In the presence of a community of agents, agents can further pursue different forms of coordination between them to complete the tasks.
